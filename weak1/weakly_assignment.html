                The Romantics first drew our attention to “awe” in the natural world and now scientists have confirmed its value.
            </p>
            <p>
                Older adults who took weekly “awe walks” reported increased positive emotions and less distress in their daily 
                lives, according to 
                <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Femo0000876">
                    a study published in the journal Emotion.
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Awe, a positive emotion triggered by an awareness of something much larger than the self – such as nature, art 
                or a collective act from concerts to political marches – can enhance feelings of generosity, wellbeing and 
                humility, 
                <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/09/418551/awe-walks-boost-emotional-well-being">
                    according to researchers at the University of California and Trinity College, Dublin.

            </p>
            <p>
                As well as health benefits, the researchers noticed differences in the walkers’ selfies, which increasingly 
                showed their surroundings rather than themselves and measurably broader smiles towards the end of the 
                eight-week study.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lead author, Virginia Sturm, said: “Experiencing awe is such a simple practice – just taking a moment 
                to look out the window or pausing to consider the technological marvels that surround us – and we now show 
                it can have measurable effects on our emotional wellbeing.”

                Here are 10 starters for your weekly awe walk.

                        Many tourists know Antrim for the Giant’s Causeway but the spectacular coast either side is far less 
                        populated. The grandeur and vertiginous expanses of dolerite on the cliffs around Fair Head are coveted
                         by rock climbers. Across the blue water lies Rathlin, Northern Ireland’s only inhabited island, Islay
                          and the rounded hummocks that are the Paps of Jura. There’s a three-mile circular walk at Murlough
                           Bay or the 33-mile Causeway Coast Way from Ballycastle in the east to Portstewart in the west.

                        is nestled within the grand amphitheatre of the Highlands and the peaks of Skye. Most walkers head for 
                        An Sgúrr, a nose-like protuberance which gives Eigg its distinctive profile, but there’s another 
                        lovely walk along the ridge Beinn Bhuidhe, which ends in a formidable crescent of columnar basalt 
                        cliffs. Peace, space, hen harriers, and the awe-inspiring story of Eigg’s revival via community 
                        ownership (bringing affordable housing and a renewable energy grid) too.

                        Almost any stretch of the 630-mile South West Coast Path from Minehead, Somerset, to Poole Harbour, 
                        Dorset, will inspire awe. The dark granite cliffs either side of 
                        <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/morwenstow">
                            Morwenstow
                        </a>
                        , north Cornwall, are perhaps the toughest of the path, with ascents along the 15-mile Hartland 
                        Quay to Bude stretch the equivalent to Ben Nevis. For easier awe, there’s a two-mile circuit from 
                        Morwenstow’s teashop to the cliffside wooden hut built by the eccentric Victorian vicar Robert Hawker.
